                <h2>Project 2</h2>
                <p>An interactive e-commerce website built for a local boutique, featuring core functionalities like a dynamic product catalog, shopping cart, and secure checkout system. The project involved extensive use of front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a robust back-end framework (such as Node.js or Django) to manage data, handle user authentication, and process transactions. Key features include a secure payment gateway integration, user registration and authentication, and a product filtering system. The codebase was structured to ensure modularity and scalability, creating a smooth, secure shopping experience that supports business growth and online sales.</p>

                <h2>Project 3</h2>
                <p>This project explores the diversity and functions of microbial communities in soil ecosystems. By analyzing soil samples from various environments, we aim to understand how microbial populations contribute to nutrient cycling, plant growth, and ecosystem resilience. Using techniques like DNA sequencing and bioinformatics, we identify and categorize microorganisms and assess their roles in soil health. This research will provide insights into sustainable agriculture practices, soil conservation, and environmental restoration, helping us harness the power of microbes to support ecological balance and improve crop productivity.</p>
